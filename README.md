# library
An Odin Assignment <br>
In this assignment from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project </a>, I make a functioning library app to store your books that you've read or haven't read. <br> 
<b>Features: </b> <br> 
<ul>
	<li> Inputs for book title, author, pages, and read/haven't read indicator</li>
	<li> Buttons to add new books, cancel inputting book, and deleting books from library</li>
</ul>
<b>Future Features: </b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Local and cloud storage <ul> 
		<li>Currently doesn't save your library</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>More dynamic elements <ul>
		<li>Mobile support/4k screen scaling</li></ul>
	</li>
